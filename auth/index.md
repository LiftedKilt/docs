## Key capabilities

Easily add a complete sign-in system to your application. WeDeploy provides a ready-to-use auth solution that handles the UI flows for signing in users with email addresses and passwords, Google Sign-In, and GitHub Login.

**Email and password**

Authenticate users with their email addresses and passwords. Provides methods to create and manage users that use their email addresses and passwords to sign in, also handles sending password reset emails.

**GitHub**

Create a client id and client secret by [registering your application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) on GitHub.

**Google**

Create a client id and client secret by [registering your application](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) on Google. 

## Initializing auth service locally

```js
WeDeploy.auth('http://auth.<projectID>.wedeploy.me');
```

## Initializing auth service on the Cloud

```js
WeDeploy.auth('http://auth.<projectID>.wedeploy.io');
```

After initialized the authentication service url, WeDeploy client stores its information for future calls.

## Sign-In With Password

```js
WeDeploy
	.auth()
	.signInWithPassword("user@domain.com", "password")
	.then(() => {
		// User is signed in.
	})
	.catch((err) -> {  
	  // User is not signed in.
	});
```

## Sign-In With Redirect (GitHub)

```js
var auth = WeDeploy.auth();

var provider = new auth.provider.Github();
provider.setProviderScope("user");

auth.signInWithRedirect(provider);

auth.onSignIn((user) => {
	// Fires when user is signed in after redirect.
});
```

## Sign-In With Redirect (Google)

```js
var auth = WeDeploy.auth();

var provider = new auth.provider.Google();
provider.setProviderScope("profile");

auth.signInWithRedirect(provider);

auth.onSignIn((user) => {
	// Fires when user is signed in after redirect.
});
```

## Sign-Out

```js
WeDeploy
	.auth()
	.signOut()
		.then(() => {
			// User is signed out.
		})
		.catch((err) -> {  
		  // User was signed out.
		});
```

## Create User

```js
WeDeploy
	.auth()
	.createUser({

		password: 'abc'
	})
	.then((user) -> {  
		// Successfully created.
	})
	.catch((err) -> {  
	  // Not created.
	});
```

	.auth()
	.getUser(userId)
	.then((user) -> {
		// User found.
	})
	.catch((err) -> {  
		// User does not exists.
	});
```


## Delete User

```js
var currentUser = WeDeploy.auth().currentUser;

currentUser.deleteUser()
	.then(() -> {  
		// Successfully deleted.
	})
	.catch((err) -> {  
	  // Not deleted.
	});
```
