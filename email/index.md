## Install Dependencies

WeDeploy relies on three dependencies, make sure to download them before we continue.

**A) Git**

Git is a version control system that is required for working with WeDeploy projects.

* [Mac OS X](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

**B) Docker**

Docker is a tool that automates the deployment of WeDeploy containers in your local environment.

* [Mac OS X](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)
* [Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi)
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)

**C) WeDeploy CLI**

The WeDeploy Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that wraps the WeDeploy Platform API, providing support for things like creating, managing and scaling applications.

## Sending an Email

Now that we have our container up and running, it's time to start sending some emails. We can use the API Client to facilitate the process of sending requests to WeDeploy.

In order to send emails, we have to make a `POST` request to `/emails` passing some required parameters like `from`, `to`, and `subject`:

```js
WeDeploy
	.url('http://<containerID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails')
	.form('from', 'from@domain.com')
	.form('to', 'to@domain.com')
	.form('subject', 'Hi there!')
	.post()
	.then(function(response) {
		console.log('Email ID:', response.body());
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		// Some error has happened
	});
```

> For the full list of parameters, check [github.com/wedeploy/email](https://github.com/wedeploy/email#readme).

As a result, we'll receive an email ID. This doesn't indicate that the email was already sent, it actually says that it was added to the email queue. That's why we have another API to check the email status.

## Checking an Email Status

In order to check if an email was sent or not, we can use the email ID from the previous example, e.g. `123`, and send a `GET` request to `/emails/123/status`.

```js
WeDeploy
	.url('http://<containerID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails/<emailID>/status')
	.get()
	.then(function(response) {
		console.log('Email status:', response.body());
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		// Some error has happened
	});
```

## What's Next?

* That's it! Now we're ready to start sending emails to our users.
