## 1. Install Dependencies

WeDeploy relies on three dependencies, make sure to download them before we continue.

**A) Git**

Git is a version control system that is required for working with WeDeploy projects.

  * [Mac OS X](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  * [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  * [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

**B) Docker**

Docker is a tool that automates the deployment of WeDeploy containers in your local environment.

  * [Mac OS X](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)
  * [Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi)
  * [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)

The WeDeploy Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that wraps the WeDeploy Platform API, providing support for things like creating, managing and scaling applications.
