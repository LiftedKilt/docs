## 1. Zero Downtime Upgrades

WeDeploy™ provides automation for updating services and the systems with zero downtime.

WeDeploy™ services can all be updated with rolling, blue-green, or canary deployment patterns. If the update fails, roll it back with a single click. These powerful tools are critical for minimizing downtime and user interruption.

## 2. Service Discovery and Load Balancing

WeDeploy™ includes several options for automating service discovery and load balancing.

Distributed services create distributed problems, but you don’t have to solve them all yourself. WeDeploy™ includes automatic DNS endpoint generation, an API for service lookup, transport layer (L4) virtual IP proxying for high speed internal communication, and application layer (L7) load balancing for external-facing services.

## 4. High Availability

WeDeploy™ is highly available and makes it easy for your services to be highly available too.

Mission-critical services require health monitoring, self-healing, and fault tolerance both for themselves and the platform and infrastructure they run on. WeDeploy™ gives you multiple layers of protection.

To achieve self-healing, WeDeploy™ services are monitored by Docker Swarm and restarted when they fail. Even legacy services that don’t support distribution or replication can be automatically restarted by Docker Swarm to maximize uptime and reduce service interruption.

## 5. Elastic Scalability

WeDeploy™ gives you the power to easily scale your services up and down with the turn of a dial.

Horizontal scaling is trivial in Docker Swarm, as long as your service supports it. You can change the number of service instances at any time. WeDeploy™ even lets you autoscale the number of instances based on session count, using the WeDeploy™ Load Balancer.

## 6. Web and Command Line Interfaces

The WeDeploy™ web and command line interfaces make it easy to monitor and manage the projects and its services.

The WeDeploy™ web dashboard lets you monitor resource allocation, running services health, and more with intuitive browser-based navigation, real-time graphs, and interactive debugging tools.

The WeDeploy™ command line interface provides control of WeDeploy™ from the comfort of a terminal. It’s powerful, yet easily scriptable, with handy plugins to interact with installed projects.
