# Understanding configuration files

###### This is an overview of how WeDeploy uses json files to help you to configure your project.

<!-- <article id="project-configuration"> -->

## Project file reference

The `project.json` file is a JSON file defining the project attributes. The default path for a `project.json` is `./project.json`.

WeDeploy uses this json file to reference to project in case it's already created. If the project does not exist, it creates a new project for you.

* Supported fields

**id**: Project uniq id.
**name**: Project name.
**homeService**: Service that will be receiving the requests in the base custom domain.
**customDomain**: Custom domain used instead the domain generated by wedeploy.

* Validations:

**id**: The id must be unique, and you may get an error message in case someone else is already using this project id.
**customDomain**: The custom domain must be unique, and you may get an error message in case someone else is already using this custom domain.

* Usage:

`project.json`
{
  "id": "projectexample",
  "name": "WeDeploy Dashboard",
  "homeContainer": "ui",
  "customDomain": "projectexample.wedeploy.com"
}

## Service file reference

The `service.json` file is a JSON file defining the service attributes and configurations. The default path for a `service.json` is `./<service_folder>/service.json`.

WeDeploy uses this json file to reference to service in case it's already created. If the service does not exist, it creates a new service for you.

* Supported fields

**id**: Service uniq id.
**type**: Service stack/image type.
**hooks**: Callbacks that should be executed in the service lifecycle. Currently allowed: `build`.
**env**: Environment variables to be exported in the service lifecycle.
**description**: Short information about the service.

* Usage:

{
  "id": "conqueror",
  "type": "wedeploy/engine",
  "description": "WeDeploy Service Example",
  "hooks": {
    "build": "./gradlew clean build installDist -x test"
  },
  "env": {
    "WEDEPLOY_USER": "user"
  }
}
