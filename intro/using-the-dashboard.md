## 1. Create an account


The first thing you need to do to get started with WeDeploy is to [request an invitation](http://wedeploy.com/).

At this moment, WeDeploy is only available to a restricted group of developers, but don't worry we're sending invites on a daily basis.

You're going to receive an invite though email with the link to create a new account.

Projects can have more than one service. In this example we're going to deploy a static website.

## 9. Access the URL generated for your service
Now that you installed the boilerplate, in the service screen is possible to see the status of the service and its URL. Click on the URL to copy to your clipboard and open that in a new tab in your browser.

## 10. It works!
That's it! Using a sofisticated Loadbalancer system and service discovering, WeDeploy automatically creates a URL and points that to your container.
